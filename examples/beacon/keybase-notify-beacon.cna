# This script adds basic keybase notification functionality to Cobalt Strike
# Ensure that you configure and started the keybase forwarder
# keybase_forwarder is the server that is going to except our curl requests and
# send the results to the keybase API
# channel is the channel you want to send the message to. Channel example "bob,alice"
# team can be empty or the team name you want to use
# when using a team the channel will be a team channel like general
# chat_type needs to be either Direct or Team
